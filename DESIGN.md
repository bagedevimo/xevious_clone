# Xevious Clone

Let's make a releasable game. We should can be proud of the quality, polish, and gameplay, and not "release" it then.

### Features:

* A campaign of levels featuring varied enemies and ai strategies, scenery, backgrounds, and weapons
* A high score (local only, not shared with the internet) system for tracking who is the best
* Drop-in drop-out second player co-op.
* Sound effects and background music
* Players should be able to configure resolution, sound volumes, and key-binds.
* Lives system, on death the player restarts the level. On running out of levels, they record their score and return to the main menu
* At least 5 levels

## Levels

### Level 1

An outdoor level introducing the player to mechanics of the game, should include every variation of weapon so players can discover which weapon they like and works well against varying enemies. Includes a boss with a single phase.

### Level 2

A level which introduces players to the concept of changing levels depending on ship position, ramps up the difficulty. Includes a boss with multiple phases.

### Level 3

TBD

### Level 4

### Level 5

## AI Strategies

### Simple

Enemies fly towards the player until entering the danger zone (either range or entering line of fire), before "fleeing" out of the scene.

### Rails

Usually used for ground enemies, causes an enemy to move along a fixed pre-programmed path.
